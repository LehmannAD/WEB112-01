<h1>Lehmann Arm's</h1>
<p>
Here at Lehmann Arm's we have a dream to develop a completely new rifle in design, form, and completely different from the current modern design and function rifles.
</p>
<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<p> 
Following a Web Design class, the CEO of Lehmann Arm's, Adam D. Lehmann decided to develop a prototype firearm that is still in the research and development process. Prototypes are not in physical production, only being designed in a physically accurate 3d design.

We do have tours of the Lehmann Arm's facility, please message us with a date you would like to visit and we will accommodate you as best as we can.

<h1>CEO Adam D. Lehmann</h1>
<h3>HIS STORY</h3>
<p>
He spent 8 Years in the United States Marine Corps as an Infantryman before being medically retired as a Sergeant. While on active duty Sergeant Lehmann deployed several times to countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kyrgyzstan, Germany, and Haiti. Today he attends College in Rockville Centre, NY in pursuit of seriously..... Any degree at this point.... in his spare time he likes to 3-D Model prototypes for military applications. He also owns literally the worst model/year Corvette Sting Ray which is a 1975! But he revived the Vette so that it can live up to its true potential, and dropped a .338 Stroker Engine with 505Hp in it so itâ€™s kind of a beast now!
